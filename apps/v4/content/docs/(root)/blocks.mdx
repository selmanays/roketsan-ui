title: Blocks
description: Create and manage reusable block components for your applications.
---

Blocks are pre-built component compositions that can be used to accelerate development. The [blocks library](/blocks) provides a collection of high-quality, reusable components for various use cases including applications, dashboards, forms, and more.

## Setup your workspace

<Steps>

### Initialize the project

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-block
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

</Steps>

## Add a block

A block can be a single component (eg. a variation of a ui component) or a complex component (eg. a dashboard) with multiple components, hooks, and utils.

<Steps>

### Create a new block

Create a new folder in the `apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/blocks` directory. Ensure the folder is named in kebab-case format.

```txt
apps
└── v4
    └── registry
        └── new-york-v4
            └── blocks
                └── dashboard-01
```

<Callout className="mt-6">

**Note:** The build script will take care of building the block for the `default` style.

</Callout>

### Add your block files

Add your files to the block folder. Here is an example of a block with a page, components, hooks, and utils.

```txt
dashboard-01
└── page.tsx
└── components
    └── hello-world.tsx
    └── example-card.tsx
└── hooks
    └── use-hello-world.ts
└── lib
    └── format-date.ts
```

<Callout className="mt-6">

**Note:** You can start with one file and add more files later.

</Callout>

</Steps>

## Add your block to the registry

<Steps>

### Add your block definition to `registry-blocks.tsx`

To add your block to the registry, you need to add your block definition to `registry-blocks.ts`.

This follows the registry schema specification for component definitions.

```tsx title="apps/v4/registry/registry-blocks.tsx" showLineNumbers
export const blocks = [
  // ...
  {
    name: "dashboard-01",
    author: "Roketsan UI",
    title: "Dashboard",
    description: "A dashboard component with integrated data visualization.",
    type: "registry:block",
    registryDependencies: ["input", "button", "card"],
    dependencies: ["zod"],
    files: [
      {
        path: "blocks/dashboard-01/page.tsx",
        type: "registry:page",
        target: "app/dashboard/page.tsx",
      },
      {
        path: "blocks/dashboard-01/components/hello-world.tsx",
        type: "registry:component",
      },
      {
        path: "blocks/dashboard-01/components/example-card.tsx",
        type: "registry:component",
      },
      {
        path: "blocks/dashboard-01/hooks/use-hello-world.ts",
        type: "registry:hook",
      },
      {
        path: "blocks/dashboard-01/lib/format-date.ts",
        type: "registry:lib",
      },
    ],
    categories: ["dashboard"],
  },
]
```

Ensure you include the following required properties: `name`, `description`, `type`, `registryDependencies`, `dependencies`, `files`, and `categories`. Each property is documented in the registry schema specification.

### Run the build script

```bash
pnpm registry:build
```

<Callout className="mt-6">

**Note:** you do not need to run this script for every change. You only need to run it when you update the block definition.

</Callout>

### View your block

Once the build script is finished, you can view your block at `http://localhost:3000/blocks/[CATEGORY]` or a full screen preview at `http://localhost:3000/view/styles/new-york-v4/dashboard-01`.

<Image
  src="/images/block-preview-light.png"
  width="1432"
  height="960"
  alt="Block preview"
  className="mt-6 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border dark:hidden"
/>
<Image
  src="/images/block-preview-dark.png"
  width="1432"
  height="960"
  alt="Block preview"
  className="mt-6 hidden w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border shadow-sm dark:block"
/>

### Build your block

You can now build your block by editing the files in the block folder and viewing the changes in the browser.

If you add more files, make sure to add them to the `files` array in the block definition.

</Steps>

## Build and test your block

Once your block is complete, build and test it before deployment.

<Steps>

### Run the build script

```bash
pnpm registry:build
```

### Capture screenshots

```bash
pnpm registry:capture
```

<Callout className="mt-6">

**Note:** If you've run the capture script before, you may need to delete existing screenshots (both light and dark variants) at `apps/v4/public/r/styles/new-york-v4` and run the script again.

</Callout>

### Review and deploy

After building and testing your block, commit your changes following your organization's version control procedures.

Your block will be reviewed according to established quality standards. Once approved, it will be published and available for installation via the CLI.

</Steps>

## Categories

The `categories` property is used to organize your block in the registry.

### Add a category

If you need to add a new category, you can do so by adding it to the `registryCategories` array in `apps/v4/registry/registry-categories.ts`.

```tsx title="apps/www/registry/registry-categories.ts" showLineNumbers
export const registryCategories = [
  // ...
  {
    name: "Input",
    slug: "input",
    hidden: false,
  },
]
```

## Guidelines

Follow these guidelines when creating blocks for the component library.

- The following properties are required for the block definition: `name`, `description`, `type`, `files`, and `categories`.
- Make sure to list all registry dependencies in `registryDependencies`. A registry dependency is the name of the component in the registry eg. `input`, `button`, `card`, etc.
- Make sure to list all dependencies in `dependencies`. A dependency is the name of the package in the registry eg. `zod`, `sonner`, etc.
- If your block has a page (optional), it should be the first entry in the `files` array and it should have a `target` property. This helps the CLI place the page in the correct location for file-based routing.
- **Imports should always use the `@/registry` path.** eg. `import { Input } from "@/registry/new-york/input"`
