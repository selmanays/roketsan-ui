description: Roketsan UI is a comprehensive enterprise design system providing consistent, accessible, and maintainable user interface components.
---

**Roketsan UI is a complete design system developed by OBSS for Roketsan.**

Traditional component libraries require you to install packages from NPM and import components into your application.

This approach works well until you need to customize a component to match Roketsan UI requirements or require functionality that isn't included in the library. **Often, this leads to wrapping library components, writing workarounds to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries with incompatible APIs.**

Roketsan UI addresses these challenges through the following principles:

- **Source Code Access:** Component source code is provided directly, enabling full customization and extension.
- **Composition:** Every component uses a common, composable interface, ensuring predictable behavior.
- **Distribution:** A structured schema and command-line tool facilitate component distribution across projects.
- **Professional Defaults:** Carefully designed default styles provide excellent design out-of-the-box.
- **Enterprise-Ready:** Components are designed for enterprise applications with consistent APIs and maintainable code.

## Source Code Access

Roketsan UI provides direct access to component source code, giving you complete control to customize and extend components according to your requirements. This approach offers:

- **Full Transparency:** Complete visibility into component implementation and structure.
- **Easy Customization:** Modify any aspect of a component to meet your design and functionality requirements.
- **Maintainability:** Direct code access enables easier maintenance and integration with your existing codebase.

_In traditional libraries, modifying a button's behavior requires overriding styles or wrapping the component. With Roketsan UI, you can directly edit the component source code._

      How do I manage updates with source code access?

      <p>
        Roketsan UI follows a headless component architecture. This means the core
        functionality of your application can receive updates by updating your dependencies, such as
        radix-ui or input-otp.

        The presentation layer, which is closest to Roketsan UI, is not
        tightly coupled with the underlying library implementation. This allows for
        independent modification and customization.

## Composition

Every component in Roketsan UI shares a common, composable interface. **If a component does not exist in the library, it can be integrated, made composable, and styled to match and work with the rest of Roketsan UI.**

_A shared, composable interface ensures predictability for your development team. You don't need to learn different APIs for each new component, including third-party integrations._

## Distribution

Roketsan UI includes a code distribution system that defines a schema for components and provides a CLI tool for distribution.

- **Schema:** A structured file format that defines components, their dependencies, and properties.
- **CLI:** A command-line tool to distribute and install components across projects with cross-framework support.

_The schema enables you to distribute your custom components to other projects within your organization and maintain consistency across applications._

## Professional Defaults

Roketsan UI provides a comprehensive collection of components with carefully designed default styles. They are engineered to work well individually and as part of a cohesive system:

- **Production-Ready:** Your UI has a professional and polished appearance without additional configuration.
- **Unified Design:** Components are designed to work harmoniously together, maintaining visual and functional consistency across your application.
- **Easily Customizable:** Modifications can be made by overriding and extending the default styles and behaviors.

## Enterprise Integration

The architecture of Roketsan UI is designed for enterprise environments. Direct source code access and consistent APIs enable seamless integration with existing development workflows and tooling.

_The component structure and consistent patterns allow development teams to efficiently understand, customize, and extend components to meet specific business requirements._
